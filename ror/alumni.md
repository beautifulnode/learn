# CodeCamp Alumni

By passing a CodeCamp course you become part of the CodeCamp Alumni.  
The CodeCamp Alumni understand that it is important to share knowledge 
and the learning of knowledge process never ends.  

Every Alumni member's picture and course will be posted on the CodeCamp 
website, and CodeCamp will have annual alumni meetups, as well as a 
mailing list which alumni can participate and communicate with other alumni 
to keep the learning and growing process going.
