# Learn NodeJs via CoffeeScript

This project is a different take on learning a technology and/or
language.  Basically, you fork and clone this project to your local
system, then in each folder there is a lesson and a excercise or two of
the lesson.  In your cloned copy you should read the lesson and work the
exercises.  When you have finished the exercises for the lesson, check
them into github and do a pull request on this project.  I won't merge
the pull request, but I will review the exercises and comment to provide
any insights or direction, or just praise you for doing a great job.

I think this will be an interesting experiement and approach to learning
a technology.  Or it may be a total failure, but it should be fun.  Also
all kinds of participation is encouraged.  If you have an idea for a
lesson, create an issue for the idea and start a discussion.  If you
want to create a lesson plan or modify an existing one to make it better
or more challenging, please fork, modify and provide a pull request.

If this works, it could be a great way to learn technologies in a very
async/interactive way.

Lets give it a shot.
